## What is an MCP

an alias for **Model Context Protocol** was initially introduced by Anthropic, helps in connecting models with external tools (e.g: Database, APIs, Documents...), it defines how ai models can access ressources in a effective secure way.

## MCP Server integrated in IDE

In this project so far, I have **terraform-mcp**, this would be useful for the ai assistant to have:

- Direct Understanding of Infrastructure
- Real-Time Terraform Operations
- Enhanced code generation based on documentation and best practices

## Added Customizations[Rules] in Windsurf

- Never run `terraform plan` neither `terraform apply`
- Always check best practices before appending in codebase

## To Add later
